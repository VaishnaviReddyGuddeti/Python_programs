# You can specify a range of indexes by specifying where to start and where to end the range.
# When specifying a range, the return value will be a new tuple with the specified items.

#Return the third, fourth, and fifth item:
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango")
print(thistuple[2:5])

#This will return the items from position 2 to 5.

#Remember that the first item is position 0,
#and note that the item in position 5 is NOT included
