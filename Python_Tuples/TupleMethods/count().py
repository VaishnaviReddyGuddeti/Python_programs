# Python has two built-in methods that you can use on tuples.
# Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a tuple

# Return the number of times the value 5 appears in the tuple:

thistuple = (1, 3, 7, 8, 7, 5, 4, 6, 8, 5)
x = thistuple.count(5)
print(x)

# Return the number of times the "BMW K 1300 R" appears in the tuple
thistuple = ("Royal Enfield" , "Harley Davidson" , "BMW K 1300 R" , "Maserati Quattroporte" , "BMW" , "MG Hector" , "BMW K 1300 R")
x = thistuple.count(BMW K 1300 R)
print(x)
