# String literals in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

# 'hello' is the same as "hello".

# You can display a string literal with the print() function:

#You can use double or single quotes:

print("Hello")
print('Hello')

# Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the string:

a = "Hello"
print(a)
