# Variables are containers for storing data values
# Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable
# A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)
# Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set
x = 4
x = "Sally"
print(x)
# String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes
x = "John"
print(x)
#double quotes are the same as single quotes
x = 'John'
print(x)
