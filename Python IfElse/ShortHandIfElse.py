# If you have only one statement to execute, one for if, and one for else, you can put it all on the same line:
# One line if else statement:

a = 2
b = 330
print("A") if a > b else print("B")

# One line if else statement, with 3 conditions:

a = 330
b = 330
print("A") if a > b else print("=") if a == b else print("B")
