# Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments.

# To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:
#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")
# Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")
# As long as the string is not assigned to a variable, Python will read the code, but then ignore it, and you have made a multiline comment.
