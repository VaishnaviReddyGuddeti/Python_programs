# There are three numeric types in Python:
 # 1.int
 # 2.float
 # 3.complex
# Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them
x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
z = 1j   # complex

# To verify the type of any object in Python, use the type() function:
x = 1
y = 2.8
z = 1j

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
